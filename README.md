I experienced trouble trying to create the VM. I kept getting error messages that told me that the zone did not have enough resources.

I also ran into some trouble trying to install MHN. I got the error message that the repository did not exist. I had to clone from a different repo.

I was unable to collect data because for some reason, after nmap command, there were no records of attacks. I discussed with a TA, but we were ultimately unable to figure out why this issue was recurring.
